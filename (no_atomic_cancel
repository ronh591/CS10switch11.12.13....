The inner and outer loops are called by the function in main() in the following way:

The outer loop iterates over the number of students, which is stored in the variable numStudents.
For each student, the outer loop calls the function calculateTotal(). This function takes two arguments: the number of tests and the student number.
The function calculateTotal() uses an inner loop to iterate over the number of tests.
For each test, the function calculateTotal() prompts the user to enter a score.
The function calculateTotal() adds the score to the total score for the student.
After the inner loop has finished iterating, the function calculateTotal() returns the total score for the student.
The outer loop then uses the returned total score to calculate the average score for the student.
The outer loop then prints the average score for the student to the console.
The following diagram illustrates how the inner and outer loops are called by the function in main():
